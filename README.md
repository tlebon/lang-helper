## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Get an Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Load the Extension

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `lang-helper` directory
6. The extension icon should appear in your toolbar

### Setup

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Select your target language from the dropdown
3. Enter your Anthropic API key
4. Toggle "Enable Assistant" on
5. Click "Save Settings"

### Add Icons (Optional)

For a complete experience, add icon images:
1. Create three PNG images: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
2. Place them in the `icons/` directory
3. Reload the extension in Chrome

## Usage

1. Navigate to any website with text input fields (Gmail, Twitter, Google Docs, etc.)
2. Start typing in your target language
3. The extension will automatically analyze your text when you focus on a text field or after you pause typing (1.5 seconds)
4. Hover over underlined text to see suggestions, explanations, and corrections
5. Click the "Replace" button in the tooltip to instantly apply the suggested correction

### Supported Text Fields

- Text inputs (`<input type="text">`)
- Textareas (`<textarea>`)
- Content-editable divs (like those in Gmail compose windows and rich text editors)

### Features in Action

- **Automatic Analysis**: Text is analyzed when you click into a field or 1.5 seconds after you stop typing
- **Smart Clipping**: Underlines are hidden when scrolled out of view or obscured by toolbars
- **Intelligent Positioning**: Tooltips automatically position themselves to stay visible
- **Progressive Corrections**: Apply corrections one at a time while keeping other suggestions visible
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Overlays are removed when you close or minimize windows

## How It Works

1. **Content Script** (`content.js`): Monitors all text input fields on web pages using MutationObserver
2. **Background Worker** (`background.js`): Sends text to Claude API for analysis with position verification
3. **Analysis**: Claude evaluates grammar, spelling, tone, and style with character-precise positioning
4. **Overlay System**: Creates positioned overlays with underlines that match the text exactly
5. **Smart Rendering**:
   - Hides marks that overlap with toolbars (e.g., Gmail compose toolbar)
   - Clips underlines when content scrolls out of view
   - Automatically removes overlays when elements are removed from DOM
6. **Interactive Tooltips**: Hover to see explanations and click "Replace" to apply corrections
7. **Position Adjustment**: After corrections, remaining suggestions are repositioned automatically

## Privacy

- Your text is sent to Anthropic's API for analysis
- API key is stored locally in Chrome's sync storage
- No data is collected or stored by this extension
- See [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

## Cost

This extension uses the Anthropic API which is a paid service:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~$3 per million input tokens
- Most analyses use 100-500 tokens
- Approximate cost: $0.0003-0.0015 per analysis

## Customization

### Change the LLM Model

Edit `background.js` line 4:
```javascript
const MODEL = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'; // Change this
```

### Adjust Analysis Delay

Edit `content.js` line 47:
```javascript
}, 1500); // Change delay in milliseconds
```

### Add More Languages

Edit `popup.html` and add options to the language select dropdown.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not working

- Check that you've entered a valid API key
- Make sure "Enable Assistant" is toggled on
- Check the browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
- Verify your API key has credits at console.anthropic.com

### No highlights appearing

- Wait 1.5 seconds after typing before expecting analysis
- Ensure you're typing at least 10 characters
- Check that the text field is supported (input, textarea, or contenteditable)

### Highlights not visible

- Check for CSS conflicts with the website's styles
- Try refreshing the page after loading the extension
