# Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editor. The icons should represent language learning or translation (e.g., a globe, speech bubble, or language symbol).

For testing, you can use placeholder images from https://via.placeholder.com/:
- https://via.placeholder.com/16
- https://via.placeholder.com/48
- https://via.placeholder.com/128
